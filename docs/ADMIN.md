# Admin Guide

## Paid Order Notification
When an order reaches the configured paid status, the admin receives a Telegram message with action buttons:
- Mark Fulfilled
- Send Voucher Code
- Mark Expired/Cancel

## Voucher Delivery
1. Tap "Send Voucher Code".
2. The bot prompts you to type the voucher code.
3. The bot sends the code to the user and marks the order as `FULFILLED`.

## Manual Fulfillment
You can also mark an order as fulfilled without sending a code.
